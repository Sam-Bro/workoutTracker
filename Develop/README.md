> an application to view, create and track daily workouts 

a Nosql applicication that allows users to view, track and create daily workouts. Users are able to log multiple exercises in a given day, track exercise specifics (weight, sets, reps, duration, distance). This project was built because consistency is key when exercising and working out, this application gives a visual representation of any fitness activities over the week to help track progress. The Nosql Workout Tracker helps solve the problem of needing a easy and convenient app to save workout information for later review. In the duration of this project, I learned working with Nosql.
